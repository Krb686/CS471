High level design
  The design of this program uses 3 three queues, as per the specification.
  The first and second queues are both round robin, while the third queue is 
    an SRTF, or shortest remaing time first queue.

  There are multiple structs used in this program to represent various components.

  ==== Processes ====

  Each process is represented by a struct with several fields. Those fields are a 
  *next pointer, a *prev pointer, a CPUburst which is itself a pointer to a struct,
  an IOburst which is another pointer to a struct, and some integers, such as the
  process id (pid), the aTime or arrival time, the wTime or wait time, and the
  rTime, or running time for that process.  

  The CPUburst struct represents a single CPUburst for that process, and is itself
  a linked list of all the CPUbursts for that process.  This is also the same case
  for the IObursts of a process.


  ==== Queues ====

  Queue structs have the following fields.

  head, which is a pointer to the first process in that queue. The process itself
  points to the next process in that queue and is adjusted accordingly for each
  queue. When a process is executed it is popped from the list and belongs to no
  queue, therefore has no next or prev.

  tQ, or the time quantum for that queue.  This is undefined for queues that do not
    have a time quantum, such as the SRTF and the IO queues. 

  status, or essentially the queue number for Q1, Q2, and Q3, and undefined for
    other queues.  This was done to be able to recognize which queue a process had
    been scheduled from in the case of a preemption.

  The first struct is called nextProc, which is not one of the primary queues, but
    represents the "arrival" queue of processes that have yet to be placed into Q1.


  IOqueues are also implemented using the same queue struct, and are simple FCFS 
    queues.


  ==== Parser ====

  A parser was used to read in all of the lines of the input file to then be processed.
    The results of the parsing are returned as a struct, and from there, the queues
    are setup in the main function.
