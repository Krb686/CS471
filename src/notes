All server funcs should taken in socket as arg since they will be
sending info?

Or we can just format the info then have a seperate send func or
just send directly in the code

Or all funcs can return an int corresponding to a certain message
i.e. login aldlkajsd returns 1 --> invalid user
login bob returns 0 --> success
login bob returns 2 --> user already logged on

should we use monitors?

Let's avoid passing in socs unnecesarily, let's just return a code
that indicates what should be sent, another function can take the
code and use it to send.

Same with buyer and seller, return a code and another function will
take care of receiving and printing.
